### Project Description
A fun, pointless app where users can submit gossips as an anonymous one or as a verified one.
It gets stored forever, creating an unchangeable ‚Äúgossip chain.‚Äù It‚Äôs completely decentralized
and doesn‚Äôt verify or fact-check anything‚Äîjust a way to immortalize random, trivial¬†rumors...
